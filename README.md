AR Soundscape combines ARKit and Bose AR headphones to create a walkable AR audio experience. 

The app allows you to create digital soundscapes by adding existing sounds, or recording new ones, and placing them in the world around you. You can then put your phone in your backpocket, and walk around your soundscape -- totally hands free.

Bose AR headphones takes this experience to the next level. You can turn your head around to scan the room for sounds, just like you would in the real world.
